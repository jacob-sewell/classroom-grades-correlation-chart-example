# Classroom Grades Correlation Report

This repository contains a pdf and two screenshots about a data visualization I did for AllofE Solutions way back in 2014.

The purpose of this README is to provide some context for the pdf, which is just the contents of a blog post I wrote for AllofE's Blogger account. Obviously the web development world has moved on from ExtJS 4, so the code snippets are probably not relevant, but hopefully the general thought process for extending a visualization remains informative.
